How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
You would be able to see spelling error quickly because one version
will have a word spelled the correct way while the other
would have the word spelled incorrectly. diff will then catch that different
and show you the result.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It helps you look up past state of your program.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Each session will have its own context in which effects the frequency of commiting changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
That's how the programming team set up the VCS to be.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log to get an overview of all the changes
git diff to view the acutally changes between two different commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
if certain changes causes the code to break, you can easily identify where the cause of the bug
is located at because version control keeps a detail history of all file changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Control many different projects!
